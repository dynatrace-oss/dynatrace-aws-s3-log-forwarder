# This file is designed to help you get started writing your log forwarding rules with examples.

---
# This is a default rule to forward logs from any S3 object created that the forwarder receives
# a notification for. It's meant to help getting started, and also enable a way to define a rule
# to apply without having to explicitly create rules for each and every S3 bucket you want to send
# logs from. You may delete it if you want to forward logs only for those buckets explicitly configured
# in this file.w1 .

  - name: forward_all
    # Match any file in your bucket
    prefix: ".*"
    # Process as AWS-vended log (automatic fallback to generic text log ingestion if log is not recognized)
